Hi! I’m **Shravan** — a researcher and engineer who enjoys working on real-world machine learning problems. These days I mostly work on **LLM-based systems**, **time-series forecasting**, and large-scale experimentation pipelines using modern ML tools. I like practical problems where good modeling, careful thinking, and solid engineering come together to make something useful.

Alongside this industry work, I also enjoy more theoretical research. I’ve published on topics like **optimal signal design**, **system identification**, **controller design**, **event-triggered control**, **rank-constrained matrix equations**, **SVM dynamics**, **reducing computations in CNNs**, **split learning**, **load balancing in microgrids**, **power allocation**, **convexity**, **threshold optimization**, and mathematical ideas like the **Bures–Wasserstein metric** and the **Newman phase**.

This website has more details on each of these if you’d like to explore them. Overall, I just enjoy learning, building things, and understanding why algorithms behave the way they do.

Outside work, I love **cooking**, **long walks**, **listening to music** (especially modern songs with a classical touch), and spending time with **family and friends**.
